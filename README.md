# AxeThrowingVR

A simple axe throwing game, developed in 24 hours for the U of U 2019 Hackathon, sponsored by MLH and Galileo.

Our team had never before worked in Unity, C#, or with the SteamVR API - so this was a learning experience for all of us, that provided an incredibly fun outlet and built us together stronger as a team, in addition to expanding our skillset.
